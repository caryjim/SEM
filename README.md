# SEM
This is a repository of LISREL and Mplus code of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. 

Project: Demonstrate high order factor model (Second order CFA model) 

The original mplus code and data came from the mplus software website: http://www.statmodel.com/usersguide/chapter5.shtml

Modification to the code reflects a two order model with 4 eta (first order) and 2 ksi (second order).

.spl are code files that built with LISREL 10.20 Student version. 

.inp are code files that built with Mplus 8.0 version.
